# Governance

Veriscope is currently maintained by a single maintainer with input from community contributors.
This document describes how decisions are made and how the project will evolve as it grows.

## Roles

- **Maintainer**: Craig Holmander (project owner). The maintainer is responsible for roadmap,
  final review, releases, and conflict resolution.
- **Contributors**: Anyone who submits issues, discussions, or pull requests.

## Decision making

- Day-to-day decisions are made by the maintainer based on issue discussion and PR review.
- Significant changes (API contracts, governance, licensing, or release policy) should be
  proposed via an issue for discussion before implementation.
- Releases follow the documented process in [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](./RELEASE_PROCESS.md).

## Path to additional maintainers

As the project grows, additional maintainers may be added based on:

- Sustained, high-quality contributions
- Familiarity with Veriscope’s contracts and governance model
- Demonstrated commitment to project stability

New maintainers are nominated by the current maintainer and approved through public discussion.

## Maintainer onboarding and succession

The project currently has a single maintainer. Long-term sustainability will be achieved by
promoting trusted contributors to maintainer status as the community grows.

In the event the maintainer becomes unavailable, project stewardship will be transferred
to an active contributor or to a neutral open-source foundation if appropriate.

## Changes to governance

Governance updates are made via pull request and require maintainer approval.

## Code of conduct

All project participants are expected to follow the
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
