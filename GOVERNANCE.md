# Governance

Veriscope is currently maintained by a single maintainer with input from community contributors.
This document describes how decisions are made and how the project will evolve as it grows.

## Roles

- **Maintainer**: Craig Holmander (project owner). The maintainer is responsible for roadmap,
  final review, releases, and conflict resolution.
- **Contributors**: Anyone who submits issues, discussions, or pull requests.

## Decision making

- Day-to-day decisions are made by the maintainer based on issue discussion and PR review.
- Significant changes (API contracts, governance, licensing, or release policy) should be
  proposed via an issue for discussion before implementation.
- Releases follow the documented process in [RELEASE_PROCESS.md](./RELEASE_PROCESS.md).

## Changes to governance

Governance updates are made via pull request and require maintainer approval.

## Code of conduct

All project participants are expected to follow the
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
