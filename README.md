# Veriscope

**Early-warning system for representation drift in machine learning models.**

Veriscope is an open research project developing tools to detect early signs of collapse in internal model diversity before they lead to brittle and unsafe behavior.  
Standard metrics often look healthy while representation structure quietly degrades.  
Veriscope provides **auditable, reproducible monitoring signals** to surface these hidden risks.

## Features

- 📉 **Representation drift detection**: monitors collapse in internal model diversity  
- 🧪 **Reproducible experiments**: validated on CIFAR-10 with ≤5% run-level false positives  
- 🔒 **Audit-ready logging**: tamper-evident traces for transparency and accountability  
- ⚡ **Lightweight overhead**: step-time slowdown in the 2–8% range

## Getting Started

⚠️ *This is an early-stage prototype.*  
The codebase is currently under active development and available to collaborators on request.  

Planned releases:  
- ✅ CIFAR-10 reproduction suite (PyTorch, ~4k LOC)  
- 🔜 Extension to language model fine-tuning runs  
- 🔜 Public Python package with verifier + benchmark tools  

---

## Documentation

- [Preprint: Finite Realism & Alignment](https://works.hcommons.org/records/yeqb5-exa68)  
- [Methodological note: Compression–Control Criterion](available on request)  

Additional technical docs and experiment logs will be added here as the project matures.
