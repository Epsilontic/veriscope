# Contributing to Veriscope

Thank you for considering a contribution.

To keep dual licensing viable, all contributors must agree to the following:

1. **CLA (Contributor License Agreement)**  
   - Before your first contribution, you must sign the Veriscope CLA (individual or corporate).  
   - Individual CLA: `CLA/INDIVIDUAL_CLA.md`  
   - Corporate CLA: `CLA/CORPORATE_CLA.md`  

2. **DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)**  
   - Each commit must include a "Signed-off-by" line (`git commit -s`).  
   - Text of the DCO: `DCO.txt`  

3. **License of Contributions**  
   - You grant Craig Holmander a license to use your contributions under AGPL-3.0-only **and**
     to relicense them commercially.  

4. **Third-Party Code**  
   - Do not contribute third-party code unless it is license-compatible and documented
     in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`.

By submitting a pull request you confirm that you have signed the CLA and comply with this policy.
