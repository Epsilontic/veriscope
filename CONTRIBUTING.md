# Contributing to Veriscope

Thank you for considering a contribution.

Because Veriscope is dual-licensed, contributions require clear provenance and licensing. Please review the requirements below before opening a pull request.

## Requirements

1. **CLA (Contributor License Agreement)**
   - Before your first contribution, you must sign the Veriscope CLA (individual or corporate).
   - Individual CLA: `INDIVIDUAL_CLA.md`
   - Corporate CLA: `CORPORATE_CLA.md`

2. **DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)**
   - Each commit must include a `Signed-off-by` line (use `git commit -s`).
   - Text of the DCO: `DCO.txt`
   - Rationale: DCO provides contributor provenance; the CLA supports dual licensing.

3. **License of Contributions**
   - Your contributions are licensed under the project’s open-source license and may also be used under commercial/proprietary terms as described in the CLA.

4. **Third-Party Code**
   - Do not contribute third-party code unless it is license-compatible and documented in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`.

## By submitting a pull request
You confirm that you have signed the appropriate CLA and that all commits in the pull request comply with the DCO policy. Pull requests that do not meet these requirements may be declined.
