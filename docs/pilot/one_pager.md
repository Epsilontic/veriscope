# Design Partner Pilot Kit (Phase 6)

Normative precedence: `docs/contract_v1.md` is the authoritative contract. This page is derived pilot guidance.

## What this is
The pilot kit is a lightweight, CLI-first workflow for running Veriscope on a control and an injected-pathology run, validating artifacts, and producing a shareable report. It follows the productization contract for artifacts, exit codes, and decision semantics in `docs/productization.md`.

## Success criteria (v0 pilot)
Measured on `gate_preset=tuned_v0` with control + injected runs:
- False Alarm Rate (post-warmup) should be ≤ 5% on control runs.
- Detection delay should be ≤ 2W iterations, where W is the gate window size.
- Overhead should be ≤ 5% wall-clock when timing fields exist.

## What to share with Veriscope
- `report.md` (generated by `veriscope report OUTDIR --format md`)
- `calibration.json` and `calibration.md` (generated by `scripts/pilot/score.py`)
- The OUTDIR capsule (if allowed), or at minimum:
  - non-partial capsules: `window_signature.json`, `results.json`, `results_summary.json`
  - partial capsules: `window_signature.json` and `results_summary.json` with `partial=true`
- `run_config_resolved.json` is recommended for reproducibility context.
- For compare workflows (`veriscope diff` or `veriscope report --compare`), include valid `governance_log.jsonl`; compare mode rejects missing/invalid governance and rejects `partial=true` capsules.
