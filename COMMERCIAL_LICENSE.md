# Commercial License for Veriscope

Veriscope is dual-licensed:

- **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0-only)**, or  
- **A commercial license** negotiated directly with the author.

If your intended use case is not compatible with AGPL obligations (for example: proprietary distribution, hosted/network-accessible deployments, or internal use where you do not want to provide corresponding source to users as required under AGPL), you can obtain a commercial license.
