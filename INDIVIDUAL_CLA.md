# Contributor License Agreement (Individual)

This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between you (“Contributor”) and Craig Holmander (“Maintainer”).

## 1. Definitions
**“Contribution”** means any original work of authorship (including code, documentation, tests, or other materials) that you intentionally submit to the Veriscope project for inclusion in the project, whether submitted via pull request, issue comment, email, or other means.

## 2. Copyright License
You grant Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute, and sublicense your Contribution, in whole or in part, as part of Veriscope.

This license allows Maintainer to distribute Veriscope under the project’s open-source license (**AGPL-3.0-only**) and/or under separate commercial or proprietary terms.

## 3. Patent License
You grant Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by its combination with the project to which it was submitted.

## 4. Patent Retaliation (Termination)
If you or any entity that you control initiate patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) alleging that Veriscope or any Contribution incorporated within Veriscope constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to Maintainer under this Agreement with respect to your Contributions shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 5. Representations
You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the licenses above. If your employer or another party has rights in your Contribution, you represent that you have received permission to submit the Contribution under this Agreement.

## 6. Disclaimer
Except for the representations in Section 5, you provide the Contribution on an “AS IS” basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind.
