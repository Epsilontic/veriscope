# Contributor License Agreement (Corporate)

This Corporate Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between the organization identified below (“Contributor”) and Craig Holmander (“Maintainer”).

By signing this Agreement, Contributor authorizes Contributions to be submitted to the Veriscope project by its employees and contractors acting on its behalf.

## 1. Definitions
**“Contribution”** means any original work of authorship (including code, documentation, tests, or other materials) that is intentionally submitted to the Veriscope project for inclusion in the project, whether submitted via pull request, issue comment, email, or other means, by an authorized representative of Contributor.

**“Submitter”** means an employee or contractor of Contributor who submits a Contribution on Contributor’s behalf.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License
Contributor grants Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute, and sublicense the Contribution, in whole or in part, as part of Veriscope.

This license allows Maintainer to distribute Veriscope under the project’s open-source license (**AGPL-3.0-only**) and/or under separate commercial or proprietary terms.

## 3. Grant of Patent License
Contributor grants Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the Contribution alone or by its combination with the project to which it was submitted.

## 4. Patent Retaliation (Termination)
If Contributor initiates patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) alleging that Veriscope or any Contribution incorporated within Veriscope constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to Maintainer under this Agreement with respect to Contributor’s Contributions shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 5. Representations and Authorization
Contributor represents that:
- it has the legal right to grant the licenses in this Agreement;
- each Submitter is authorized to submit Contributions under this Agreement; and
- to the best of Contributor’s knowledge, Contributions submitted by its Submitters do not include third-party code that would impose additional restrictions on Veriscope beyond those stated in the project license and this Agreement.

## 6. No Other Rights; No Support Obligation
Except for the licenses expressly granted in this Agreement, Contributor retains all right, title, and interest in its Contributions. Maintainer is not obligated to provide support, maintenance, warranties, or indemnification to Contributor.

## 7. Disclaimer
Except for the representations in Section 5, Contributions are provided on an “AS IS” basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind.

## 8. Entire Agreement
This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties regarding Contributions and supersedes any prior agreements on that subject.
